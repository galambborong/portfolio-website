        <p>I have dipped my feet into coding once or twice over the years, but it was in April 2020 when Pluralsight was free for the month that I really discovered my interest all things code!</p>
        <p>I trained as a pianist, composer and viola player at a music school before studying music at university. If you're interested in my musical activities, you can read here.</p>
        <p>I've been feeling quite 'stuck' between trying to earn my keep and doing what I love. The discovery of coding seems to have struck a chord (no pun intended!) and I am excited to be moving into the fast-paced and exciting world of tech!</p>
